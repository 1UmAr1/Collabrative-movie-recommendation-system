# Collabrative-movie-recommendation-system
Data cleaning, feature engineering, Data visualization, Data preprocessing in R programming, Model Training, validation and testing in Python programming
A fully functional Collaborative movie recommendation system. This project is divided into two phases
Phase 1 Data Preprocessing.
For Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing i have used R programming. To maximize the accuracy of the model i have used natural language processing techniques on one of the textual features.
Phase 2  Model Training, Validating and testing.
For Model Training, Validation, Testing i have used python programing language. As part of the experiment i have tried 5 algorithms.
The final model was an Stacked LSTM neural network with more then 87 percent accuracy on training, 84 percent accuracy on validation and 83 percent accuracy while testing
